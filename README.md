# notehero

Notehero is an educational-oriented program. I made it because, as I was trying to learn how to read music to play the flute, I found that flashcards did nothing for me - I needed to make some kind of connection between the page and my hands (muscle memory, etc.).

This program, called Chops (the original title) is just an initial prototype - so far, it works fine - but it's quite cumbersome in length (and not to mention somewhat heavy on processing). It needs to be refactored into multiple js files to make it more readable/approachable. Additionally, I'm interested in moving this to the backend with React (at least the computational updates) so as to make the application much more lightweight. Some things that are part of my todo list in the near future:

- Update the JavaScript to ES2015+ styles (for more efficient, readable coding).
- Refactor into multiple objects, possibly a game object, audio utils, summary/data object, and new-game-config object.
- Add more functionality like multiple key signatures (currently just C...), multiple clefs, and rhythm/time signatures (playing in time).
- Add different notes, like eigth, sixteenth, dotted, etc.
- Add a multiplier for score for playing on more difficult settings.
- Test with a wider set of instruments (not just my flute!).
- Move to backend (React).
